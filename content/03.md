#### 1. Creating a Project and User at the CLI

Back to our story. Remember, we still promised our customer Vault Tek Enterprise that they could have access to a project space with a single user, Chester Copperpot. Let's try setting this user up at the CLI.

0. SSH to the IP address of your controller (PuTTy is fine). If you are unsure how to do this, or what your controller's IP address is, ask the instructor.

0. Login as admin using the same password you use to access the OpenStack Horizon web console.

0. Issue the following commands:

    `[root@controller] # source keystonerc_admin`

    >This command applies variables to the bash environment. It prevents you from issuing needlessly long CLI commands. This will be covered in another lesson if it has not been covered already.

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)] # keystone tenant-create --name vault_tek`

    > Keystone's job is management of users and credentials, so it should follow that we issue this command to the keystone service.

    Did you notice the error message that came up? If you didn't, let's check it out now. You should have received a similar warning to the following screenshot:

    >This error is because the OpenStack project doesn't want users to issue commands directly to services. Instead, the new way is to first run the command openstack, which will cause you to enter the openstack-python 'wrapper'. From there, you could issue a 'simpler' command like project create vault_tek both ways work, but we think it is more clear to issue the commands directly to services. Afterall, we are trying to understand how these services relate to one another. We'll conclude this lab by working with the OpenStack python wrapper.

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)] # keystone user-create --name chestercopperpot --tenant vault_tek --pass pa55w0rd --email chester@vault_tek.example`

    > This command creates the user chestercopperpot, within the tenant (project) vault_tek, the password fa5tpa55w0rd, and the email address chester@vault_tek.example

    > If this command is successfully run, you should see output similar to the following screenshot:

    ![](https://i.imgur.com/JpYyIlv.png)

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)] # keystone tenant-list`

    >This keystone command will display the tenants (projects) currently available. It is analogous to looking at the Identity > Projects page in the Horizon dashboard.

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)] # keystone user-list`

    >This keystone command will display the users that have been created in the system. It is analogous to looking at the Identity > Users page in the Horizon dashboard

0. Log in as `chestercopperpot:fa5tpa55w0rd`

0. When you log in, you should be part of the new project called vault_tek. Click around, and make sure everything appears as you would expect it to within the OpenStack Horizon dashboard.

0. That's it! Good job. Leave everything the way it is. We'll tweak the acme_inc and vault_tek tenants (projects) in a subsequent lab.

#### 2. Creating a Project at the CLI (using python-openstackcleint) â€“ Reference & Rocket Scientists only
This section is only for reference. It shows the steps that you would need to take to use python-openstackclient to create the project 'vault_tek' and the user 'chestercopperpot'. You already did this so there is no need to do it a second time. However, if you are a rocket scientist and finished this lab early, feel free to stare & compare and play around with the python-openstackclient environment.

0. SSH into your controller as root, then type the following commands:

    `[root@controller] # source keystonerc_admin`

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)] # openstack`

    `(openstack) project create vault_tek`

    `(openstack) user create chestercopperpot --project vault_tek --password fa5tpa55w0rd --email chester@vault_tek.example`
