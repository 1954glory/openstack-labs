### Lab Objective

The Neutron service can not be well controlled from the OpenStack Horizon dashboard. However, visually minded individuals may find it helpful to use the Horizon dashboard to to examine current network configuration as it does produce very clear illustrations of current network configuration. At the conclusion of this lab, students should feel comfortable creating and modifying network settings with Neutron at the CLI.

#### 1. Creating a virtual network and a router with OpenStack Horizon dashboard

In this section, we'll create a network for a tenant (acme_inc), so that you can compare and contrast the differences between working with the OpenStack Horizion dashboard, and the CLI commands.

0. Log into the OpenStack Horizon dashboard on the controller as `aliceanderson:fa5tpa55w0rd`

0. Navigate to **Project > Network > Network Topology**

    ![create network](https://i.imgur.com/HpU9M54.png)

0. Fill out the pop up box with the following information:

    ```
    NetworkName: acme-inc-network
    AdminState: UP
    ```

    ![](https://i.imgur.com/D5SobdW.png)


0. Fill out the next screen with the following information:

    ```
    CreateSubnet: (checked)
    SubnetName: acme-inc-network-subnet-10
    NetworkAddress: 10.10.0.0/24
    IPVersion: IPv4
    GatewayIP: 10.10.0.1
    ```

    ![](https://i.imgur.com/Ym9p55g.png)

0. Finally, on the last screen, click the **"Create" button**

    > The Network Topology screen you are on should change to reflect the creation of this new network.

0. Let's create a router to connect our new network acme-inc-network to the network public. Click on the **"+Create Router"** button in the upper right corner.

0. Fill out pop up box with the following information:

    ```
    RouterName: acme-inc-router
    AdminState: UP
    ExternalNetwork: public
    ```

    ![](https://i.imgur.com/2Nt0QYz.png)

    >The Network Topology page should now display the new router connected to the network public.

    ![](https://i.imgur.com/l38YQMi.png)

0. All that is left is to connect this router to the acme-inc-network. Start by navigating to **Project > Network > Routers**

0. Click on the router named **acme-inc-router**

0. Now click on the tab labeled **"Interfaces"**

0. Finally click on the button **"+ Add Interface"** in the upper right corner.

0. Fill out the pop up box with the following information:

    ```
    Subnet: acme-inc-network: 10.10.0.0/24
    IPAddress: 10.10.0.1
    RouterName: acme-inc-router 
    RouterID: 
    ```
   
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/3H9fPii.png)

0. Finally, navigate back to **Project > Network > Network Topology**

0. The Network Topology screen should appear like the following screenshot:

    ![](https://i.imgur.com/IA5YvWS.png)

    > Because the user chestercopperpot is part of a different project (vault_tek), he should not be able to see the newly created network (acme_inc_network). Let's confirm this...

0. Log out of the OpenStack Horizon dashboard, and log back in as `chestercopperpot:fa5tpa55w0rd`

0. Navigate to **Project > Network > Network Topology**

    > The user chestercopperpot should only see the public and private networks.

#### 2. Creating a virtual network and a router at the CLI

In this section, we'll create almost the same network for a different tenant (vault_tek), so that you can compare and contrast the differences between working with the OpenStack Horizion dashboard and the CLI commands.
SSH to your controller and log in as root (you might use PuTTy for this).
Once logged into the controller, issue the following commands:

0. Creat a network called vault-tek-network

    `[root@controller] # source keystonerc_chestercopperpot`

    > Expect future promts to be `[root@controller ~(keystone_chestercopperpot) #` in this section.  For brevity the will shorten this promt in the lab documentation to `#`.

    `# neutron net-create vault-tek-network`

    ![](https://i.imgur.com/ZKividy.png)

0. Creat a create a vault-tek-network subnet

    `# neutron subnet-create --name vault-tek-network-subnet-10 --gateway 10.10.0.1 vault-tek-network 10.10.0.0/24`

    ![](https://i.imgur.com/XJvIVVA.png)

0. Creat a create a vault-tek-network router 

    `# neutron router-create vault-tek-router`

0. Connect vault-tek-router to the public network
    
    `# neutron router-gateway-set vault-tek-router public`

0. Connect the vault-tek-router to vault-tek-network-subnet-10

    `# neutron router-interface-add vault-tek-router vault-tek-network-subnet-10`

0. Log into the OpenStack Horizon dashboard as `chestercopperpot: fa5tpa55w0rd`

0. Navigate to **Project > Network > Network Topology**

    ![](https://i.imgur.com/b0lwOa8.png)

0. Navigate to **Project > Network > Networks**

    ![](https://i.imgur.com/zMUR30S.png)

    > Note that this network is not a shared network (see the big red arrow on the above screenshot), therefore it cannot be seen by other projects (tenants). Let's confirm this. 

0. Log out of the OpenStack Horizon dashboard, log back in as a different user (admin, aliceanderson, or bobbarker) and navigate back to ( Project > Network > Networks ). You should no longer see vault-tek-network. After you've confirmed that the network is indeed private, log back into the OpenStack Horizon dashboard as chestercopperpot.

0. Navigate to **Project > Network > Routers**

0. Click on the router instance vault-tek-router (the bright red arrow is pointing to it in the above screenshot).

    ![](https://i.imgur.com/uT02XJv.png)

0. Spend some time checking out the information being presented here. Note that the router is connected to a Gateway (public). Finally, click on the interfaces tab (the bright red arrow is pointing to it in the above screenshot). This page displays a list of associated interfaces connected to the router. Note that this router has a fixed IP address (10.10.0.1), which connects it to the 10.10.0.0/24 network we just created.
