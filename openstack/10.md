## Lab Objective

CirrOS (test) images for OpenStack
 
We keep talking about CirrOS. If it hasn't been explained already, CirrOS is a minimal (CirrOS < 15Mb) Linux distro that was designed for testing cloud instances (such as those on an OpenStack compute node). Take a minute, and check out all of the CirrOS downloads available by navigating to: https://download.cirros-cloud.net/.

Also be aware that if your deployment is using QEMU or KVM, OpenStack recommends that you use images using the qcow2 format. The most recent 64-bit qcow2 image is available at: https://download.cirros-cloud.net/ cirros-0.3.4-x86_64-disk.img

#### 1. Creating a new image with glance at the CLI

0. SSH to your controller and log in as root (you might use PuTTy for this)

0. Once logged into the controller, issue the following command:

	`[root@controller ~] # source keystonerc_admin`

	`[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)] # image-list`

	`[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)] # glance image-create --name cirros_alpha --disk-format qcow2 --container-format bare --is-public true --location https://download.cirros-cloud.net/0.3.4/cirros-0.3.4-x86_64-disk.img`

	`[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)] # image-list`

 
#### 2. Creating a new image with python-openstackclient

We'll try adding an image with the python-openstackclient so that you have some experience using each. Just a heads up, this python-openstackclient in the Kilo release has a bug in it. Sometimes when importing an image, the image will get stuck in a state of queuing. The problem seems to go away once the controller is rebooted, but it only further illustrates why administrators would prefer to issue commands directly to the OpenStack services themselves than work from the python-openstackclient.

0. Type the following commands:

	`[root@controller ~] # source keystonerc_admin`

	`[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)] # openstack`

	> This command will change your user prompt to (openstack)
 
	`(openstack) image list`

	>Take note of the available images, because we're going to add another.

	`(openstack) image create --location https://download.cirros-cloud.net/0.3.4/cirros-0.3.4-x86_64-disk.img --disk-format qcow2 --unprotected --public cirros_beta`

	>OpenStack has a n

	`(openstack) image list
