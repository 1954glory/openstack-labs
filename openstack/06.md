## Lab Objective

Of course, launching instances may be performed from the Horizon Dashboard, 
but there is more power in launching instances from the CLI. 
At the conclusion of this lab, students should be able to launch an instance from the CLI via Nova, as well as with the python-OpenStackclient

#### 1. Creating new (public) flavors at the CLI

0. SSH to your controller and log in as root 

  `[root@controller ] # source keystonerc_admin`

  `(keystone_admin)# nova flavor-list`

0. Create a 'flavor' with ID 6, 512 Mb of RAM, 2 volumes, and 1 VCPU

  `(keystone_admin)# nova flavor-create custom.shrimpy 6 512 2 1`

0. Look for shrimpy on the flavor list as each user

  `(keystone_admin)# nova flavor-list`

  `(keystone_admin)# source keystonerc_aliceanderson`

  `(keystone_aliceanderson)# nova flavor-list`

  > Alice Anderson should see the presence of custom.shrimpy

  `(keystone_aliceanderson)# source keystonerc_chestercopperpot`

  `(keystone_chestercopperpot)# nova flavor-list

  >The user chestercopperpot should see the presence of custom.shrimpy

#### 2. Creating new (private) flavors at the CLI

Alice Anderson and her team might need a custom flavor that is uniquely tuned for a project she is working on.For example, Alice's team needs to occasionally render video on a 'monster' instance with 128 GB of memory. We want Alice and her team to have access to this instance, but not our other customers. 

If we create a new flavor as described above, the user would have access to the custom flavor, but so would all other tenants in the cloud. Giving everyone access to a 'monster' flavor might not be desirable. Customers not requiring (or paying) for the 'monster' flavor might drive our cloud into full capacity rather quickly. 

0. To prevent this, lets restrict access to the custom flavor.

    `(keystone_chestercopperpot)# nova help flavor-create`

0. Notice that a flavor may have an optional argument --is-public to be set as true or false, where the default is true. Let's toggle it to false and see what happens.

    `[root@controller] # source keystonerc_admin`

    `(keystone_admin)# nova flavor-create --is-public false secret.monster 7 125000 8 200`
    
    `(keystone_admin)# nova flavor-list`
    
    >The admin should not see the flavor secret.monster displayed, as the tenant admin was not given access to the project

    `(keystone_admin)# nova help | grep flavor`
   
    `(keystone_admin)# nova help flavor-access-add`
   
    `(keystone_admin)# keystone tenant-list`
   
    > Highlight the Tenant_ID associated with the tenant admin
   
    `(keystone_admin)# nova flavor-access-add 7 now-right-click-to-paste-what-you-highlighted-in-the-last-step`
   
    `(keystone_admin)# nova flavor-list`
   
    > The admin should now see the flavor secret.monster displayed, as the tenant admin has been given access to the project.

0. Highlight the Tenant_ID associated with the tenant acme_inc`
	
    `(keystone_admin)# nova flavor-access-add 7 now-right-click-to-paste-what-you-highlighted-in-the-last-step`
    
    `(keystone_admin)# source keystonerc_aliceanderson`
    
    `(keystone_aliceanderson)# nova flavor-list`
    
    >Alice Anderson should see the presence of secret.monster displayed, as the tenant acme_inc was given access to the project
    
    `(keystone_aliceanderson)# source chestercopperpot`

    `(keystone_chestercopperpot)# nova flavor-list`
   
    >The user chestercopperpot should not see the flavor secret.monster, as the tenant vault_tek was not given access to the project.

#### 3. Launching instances from the CLI

0. SSH to your controller and log in as root 

    `[root@controller ] # source keystonerc_chestercopperpot`

    `(keystone_chestercopperpot)# nova flavor-list`

    `(keystone_chestercopperpot)# nova image-list`

    `(keystone_chestercopperpot)# neutron net-list`

0. Highlight the id of the vault-tek-network
 
0. Boot an instance called vt1 with the flavor custom.shrimpy, from the image cirros, with the security group rules http-ssh, with the ssh-key vault-key, and place it on the network vault-tek-network

    ```
    (keystone_chestercopperpot)# nova boot \
        --flavor custom.shrimpy --image cirros \ 
        --security-group http-ssh --key-name vault-key \
        --nic net-id=<vault-tek-network-id> vt1
    ```

0. Display a list of the running instances within the current tenant

    `(keystone_chestercopperpot)# nova list`

    ![](https://i.imgur.com/oQKYFQz.png)

0. Display information only about the running instance vt1

    `(keystone_chestercopperpot)# nova show vt1`

#### 4. Log into the newly created instance via the CLI

The objective of this section is to log into the newly created instance from the CLI. In order to do so, we'll need to work with namespaces which will be known to the Neutron and compute nodes. Therefore, we'll start by logging into the Neutron server and exploring the known namespaces.

0. SSH to your Neutron node and log in as root (you might use PuTTy for this).

0. Display the known namespaces. These are typically ordered in the way they were created (most recent on the bottom). We are concerned with those that begin with 'qrouter-', so you could assume that the bottom most namespace is the one we need.

    `[root@neutron ] # ip netns list`

    > The resulting list should look something like the screenshot below. Notice, there are two qrouter entries. One is for the router associated with acme_inc, and the second is for the router associated with vault_tek (the one we want). To determine which namespace ID we need, we'll have to go on a little journey. There's actually two fairly simply methods to determine which one is correct; one uses the CLI, and the other uses Horizon. Try both of the following methods to determine which one is correct.

0. The CLI way of doing things is to create a keystonerc_chestercopperpot file on the neutron server that we can source.

    `[root@neutron ] # nano keystonerc_chestercopperpot`

0. Copy and paste the following text into the new file `keystonerc_chestercopperpot`

    ```
    export OS_USERNAME=chestercopperpot
    export OS_TENANT_NAME=vault_tek
    export OS_PASSWORD=fa5tpa55w0rd
    export OS_AUTH_URL=http://192.168.0.10:5000/v2.0/
    export OS_REGION_NAME=RegionOne
    export PS1='[\u@\h \W(keystone_chestercopperpot)]\$ '
    ```

    `[root@neutron ] # source keystonerc_chestercopperpot`

    `(keystone_chestercopperpot)# neutron router-list`

0. What is displayed should be a list of all the routers associated with the project for which chestercopperpot is associated (vault_tek). Notice that the id with the red circle matches the bottom most qrouter entry that was displayed when we ran the `ip netns list` command. This is our indication that we're looking at the correct namespace id. However, we can further verify this with Horizon.

0. Log into the Horizon dashboard.
