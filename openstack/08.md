## Lab Objective

Understand security groups

### **NEEDS MORE: explain what they are briefly and what we are going to do in this lab**

#### 1. Creating Security Groups at the CLI

0. SSH to your controller and log in as root 

0. Source the keystone environment variables we setup in the previous lab

    `[root@controller ] # source keystonerc_chestercopperpot`
    
    > Expect future promts to be `[root@controller ~(keystone_chestercopperpot) #` in this section.  For brevity the will shorten this promt in the lab documentation to `#`.

0. Examine the current security group rules available to the vault-tek project (the project to which chestercopperpot belongs)

    `# nova secgroup-list`
	  
    > A single security group rule will exist, this is default.

	  `# nova secgroup-list-rules default`

0. We need to create a few basic security group rules which we can apply to our instances. The group that is about to be created is called `http-ssh`
    `# nova secgroup-create http-ssh "Allowing http and ssh traffic"`

0. Create an exception for TCP traffic coming to and from port 80 via any IP address
    
    `# nova secgroup-add-rule http-ssh tcp 80 80 0.0.0.0/0`

0. Create an exception for TCP traffic coming to and from port 22 via any IP address

    `# nova secgroup-add-rule http-ssh tcp 22 22 0.0.0.0/0`

0. Review the rules that we just created for http-ssh security group

    `# nova secgroup-list-rules http-ssh`

### **THERE'S LOTS OF CROSSED OUT STUFF AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS LAB on CREATING KEPAIRS AT THE CLI**

### Is there any plans on testing these created security groups?
