### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to further your understanding of OpenStack Identity service (Keystone). Having appropriate credentials is required if you wish to use any CLI tools to query on the OpenStack services. 

To use an OpenStack cloud, you need to authenticate against the Identity service Keystone (which returns a Token and the Service Catalog). To request an authentication token, you must supply a payload of credentials in the authentication request. Credentials are usually a combination of your user name and password, and optionally, the name or ID of the tenant in which your cloud runs. Alternatively, you can supply a token rather than a user name and password. When you send API requests, you include the token in an HTTP header called the "X-Auth-Token" header. 

If you access multiple OpenStack services, you must get a token for each service. A token is valid for a limited time before it expires. A token can also become invalid for other reasons. For example, if the roles for a user change, existing tokens for that user are invalid. Credentials allow OpenStack services to determine where your service endpoints and your authentication information are located.

#### 1. Understanding permissions
 
0. SSH to your controller and log in as root (you might use PuTTy for this)
0. Once logged into the controller, issue the following command:

    `[root@controller ~] # nova flavor-list`

    >This command will result in an error. Consider why. Nova doesn't know who you are. Do you have permissions to issue flavor-list?

    `[root@controller ~] # keystone tenant-list`

    >This command will result in an error. Keystone doesn't know who you are. Do you have permissions to view the current tenants?

    `[root@controller ~] # openstack`

    >OpenStack is a python wrapper that seeks to unify a set of commands across all the OpenStack services. The same way you log into the Horizon dashboard as a user, you need to log into OpenStack as a user.
 
0. At the moment, we are not focused on what the flavor-list command is. Just focusing on the permissions required to issue that command.
    
    `[root@controller ~] # nova --os-auth-url=http://192.168.0.10:5000/v2.0 --os-tenant-name=admin --os-user-name=admin --os-password=alta3 flavor-list`

    >Only now should the available flavors be displayed. That is because the above command included values of environmental variables that disclose your permissions. Nova can use this information to make an API call to the Keystone service and determine if you (admin) have sufficient permissions to execute the command (flavor-list)
    >

0. So it worked, but we had to include a long list of environmental variables. If you'd like, trying using just Nova flavor-list again (without the --flags). 

    >Once again, it didn't work. What you're finding is that you need to include these environmental variables every time you issue commands to manipulate your OpenStack cloud.

0. Try typing the following commands to understand the above environmental variables better:

    `[root@controller ~] # nova -h`
 
    `[root@controller ~] # nova -h | grep os-auth-url`
 
    `[root@controller ~] # nova -h | grep os-tenant-name`
 
    `[root@controller ~] # nova -h | grep os-user-name`

0. Let's go a step further and issue the same command, but this time include a debug flag and see if we can really dive deep into what is going on!

    `[root@controller ~] # nova --os-auth-url=http://192.168.0.10:5000/v2.0 --os-tenant-name=admin --os-user-name=admin --os-password=alta3 --debug flavor-list`

#### 2. Environment Variables 

Advanced Linux users, feel free to skip this section. If you are not an advanced Linux user, it may be helpful to have an understanding of parent versus child processes as well as how to set environmental versus shell variables. A child session is spawned by a parent session. An environmental variable will be passed onto child sessions whereas a shell variable will only be available in our current session. To better understand the difference, perform this quick procedure where first you'll define a shell variable and then an environmental variable within parent and child bash shells.

0. Create a shell variable within the current session. Convention says it should be all caps. Because the string we've defined includes a bang, we're using single quotes.

    `[root@controller ~] # LEARNING_VAR='Hello OpenStack!'`

    > We can confirm that this is a shell variable that will not be passed down to child processes by grepping within output from set.

    `[root@controller ~] # set | grep LEARNING_VAR`

0. LEARNING_VAR='Hello OpenStack!' should be displayed. Now confirm it is not an environmental variable by performing the same procedure with printenv.

    `[root@controller ~] # printenv | grep LEARNING_VAR`

    >No output should be returned.

0. Let's take a moment to demonstrate how to access any shell or environmental variable. When the shell encounters a `$` sign, it takes it to mean that it should substitute the value of the variable when it comes across it. Type the following command.

    `[root@controller ~] # echo $LEARNING_VAR`

    >The string Hello OpenStack! should be displayed.

0. If you type 'bash', you'll spawn a child shell. Our variable, `$LEARNING_VAR`, should not be passed onto this child session. Type the following to test this assertion.

    `[root@controller ~] # bash`

    `[root@controller ~] # echo $LEARNING_VAR`

    >No output should be displayed. 

0. Type exit to close the child session and return to the original session.

    `[root@controller ~] # exit`

    `[root@controller ~] # echo $LEARNING_VAR`

    > Once again, the string Hello OpenStack! should be displayed.

0. Now let's make LEARNING_VAR an environmental variable by using the export command.

    `[root@controller ~] # export $LEARNING_VAR`

    `[root@controller ~] # printenv | grep LEARNING_VAR`

0. Now `TEST_VAR=Hello OpenStack!` should be displayed. Once again, spawn a child shell.

    `[root@controller ~] # bash`

    `[root@controller ~] # echo $LEARNING_VAR`
 
    >Hello OpenStack! should be displayed. 

0. Confirm that it is still set as an environmental variable.

    `[root@controller ~] # printenv | grep LEARNING_VAR`

0. Now let's set an environmental variable from within our current child shell.

    `[root@controller ~] # export NEW_LEARNING_VAR='Bonjour OpenStack!'`

0. Confirm that it was indeed set as an environmental variable. Then exit the child session and return to the parent shell.

    `[root@controller ~] # printenv | grep NEW_LEARNING_VAR`

    `[root@controller ~] # exit`

0. Now see if the environmental variable NEW_LEARNING_VAR is still available.

    `[root@controller ~] # printenv | grep NEW_LEARNING_VAR`

    >No output is returned. This is because `NEW_LEARNING_VAR` was an environmental variable set in the child shell. Emphasis on the word 'was', because when we exited our child shell, that environmental variable was destroyed.

0. The original variable, LEARNING_VAR can be changed back into a shell variable (demoted), by using export and the -n flag.

    `[root@controller ~] # export -n LEARNING_VAR`

0. Test that it is no longer a global variable, but still a shell variable

    `[root@controller ~] # printenv | grep LEARNING_VAR`

    >No output will be shown as LEARNING_VAR is no longer an environmental variable.

    `[root@controller ~] # echo $LEARNING_VAR`

    >Hello OpenStack! should be displayed, as LEARNING_VAR is now a shell variable.

    `[root@controller ~] # set | grep LEARNING_VAR`

    >`LEARNING_VAR='Hello OpenStack!'` will be displayed, confirming `LEARNING_VAR` exists as a shell variable.

0. A shell and environmental variable can be completely removed by issuing the unset command.

    `[root@controller ~] # unset LEARNING_VAR`
 
    `[root@controller ~] # echo $LEARNING_VAR`
 
    >Nothing will be displayed, as `LEARNING_VAR` has been unsfalse
    `[root@controller ~] # set | grep LEARNING_VAR`

    >Nothing will be displayed.

#### 3. Getting User Credentials ( source keystonerc_admin)

Setting flag on every CLI command involves far too much typing. Let's make our commands easier to issue by setting some environmental variables for our current bash session.

0. Type the following commands:

    `[root@controller ~] # cat keystonerc_admin`
 
    >This command will display the contents of keystonerc_admin. The export command within this file will mark each VAR for automatic export to the environment of subsequently executed commands (i.e. make the local shell variable VAR global). Essentially, we can set all of our permissions in this file, source this file, and then not have to ever type our permissions again as they'll always be available to the bash environment.
    >
    >NOTE: The name of this file may change slightly depending on your environment. RDO deployments use the formatting structure keystonerc_$USER

    Content and comments on `keystonerc_admin`:

    ``` 
    # Sets the user name 
    export OS_USERNAME=admin
    # This is the tenant, or project
    export OS_TENANT_NAME=admin
    # Password for the above user
    export OS_PASSWORD=alta3
    # The Identity API served through Keystone
    export OS_AUTH_URL=http://192.168.0.10:5000/v2.0/
    export OS_REGION_NAME=RegionOne
    # Appends the CLI prompt with keystone_admin
    export PS1='[\u@\h \W(keystone_admin)]\$ '
    ``` 

0. Display a list of the environmental variables currently set

    `[root@controller ~] # printenv`

0. Look over the displayed entries. Do you see any mention of the aforementioned credentials, such as `OS_TENANT_NAME` or `OS_USERNAME`? (Feel free to use grep if you'd like.)

0. Set the environmental variables found in `keystonerc_admin`

    `[root@controller ~] # source keystonerc_admin`

    > This is a bash shell built-in command that executes the content of the file passed as a argument in the current shell. It is synonymous with ' . ' (period). After executing the above command, the CLI line will change. This is just a reminder that you are now passing commands to the OpenStack services as some user (in this case admin).

0. Once again, display a list of the environmental variables currently set.

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)] # printenv`

    > Look over the displayed entries. Now you will see a listing for the variables contained within `keystonerc_admin`, such as `OS_TENANT_NAME` and `OS_USERNAME`.

    > Just for your understanding, these entries are only set for this current bash session. If you type exit, then reconnect as root, these variables will unset themselves. If you want to remove them manually, use the unset command.

    > Expect future promts to be `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin) #` in this section.  For brevity the will shorten this promt in the lab documentation to `(keystone_admin)#`.

    `(keystone_admin)# nova flavor-list`
 
    >This time it should just work without having to type the extra permissions. Try executing a few more commands to the other OpenStack services as well.

    `(keystone_admin)# keystone tenant-create --name temp_tenant`
 
    `(keystone_admin)# keystone user-list`
 
    `(keystone_admin)# openstack`
 
    >This should launch the `python-openstackclient`

0. `(openstack) exit`

#### 4. Creating a `keystonerc_chestercopperpot` file for Chester Copperpot of Vault Tek

Remember our buddy Chester Copperpot of Vault Tek? You should see him when you issued the previous command keystone user-list.

Let's make it easy for us to execute OpenStack commands as Chester Copperpot who is part of the project `vault_tek` at the CLI.

0. Set the environmental variables found in `keystonerc_admin` if this is not already done

    `[root@controller ~] # source keystonerc_admin`
    
    > Expect future promts to be `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin) #` in this section.  For brevity the will shorten this promt in the lab documentation to `(keystone_admin)#`.

0. List the keystone users

    `(keystone_admin)# keystone user-list`
 
0. Look at the user chestercopperpot, and note his tenantID.

    `(keystone_admin)# keystone tenant-list`

0. Search for chestercopperpot's tenantID value and note the name of the tenant he belongs to (should be vault_tek)

0. Make a copy of the keystonerc_admin file so we can edit it
    
    `(keystone_admin)# cp keystonerc_admin keystonerc_chestercopperpot`

    `(keystone_admin)# nano keystonerc_chestercopperpot`

0. Edit `keystonerc_chestercopperpot` so it looks like the following:

    ```
    export OS_USERNAME=chestercopperpot
    export OS_TENANT_NAME=vault_tek
    export OS_PASSWORD=fa5tpa55w0rd
    export OS_AUTH_URL=http://192.168.0.10:5000/v2.0/
    export OS_REGION_NAME=RegionOne
    export PS1='[\u@\h \W(keystone_chestercopperpot)]\$ '
    ```
0. Display the contents of keystonerc_chestecopperpot and verify that they are correct

    `(keystone_admin)# cat keystonerc_chestercopperpot`

0. Set global variables in the current shell to correspond with the user chestercopperpot

    `(keystone_admin)# source keystonerc_chestercopperpot`

0. Note the CLI changed. Run commands and see how the results differ from chester's perspective.

    `(keystone_chestercopperpot)# nova flavor-list`

    `(keystone_chestercopperpot)# keystone tenant-list`

    > This should result in an HTTP 403 failure, as the user chesetercopperpot does not have sufficient permissions to issue this keystone command.

0. Let's repeat the process for the user aliceanderson

    `(keystone_admin)# cp keystonerc_admin keystonerc_aliceanderson`

    `(keystone_admin)# nano keystonerc_aliceanderson`

0. Edit `keystonerc_aliceanderson` so it looks like the following:

    ```
    export OS_USERNAME=aliceanderson
    export OS_TENANT_NAME=acme_inc
    export OS_PASSWORD=fa5tpa55w0rd
    export OS_AUTH_URL=http://192.168.0.10:5000/v2.0/   
    export OS_REGION_NAME=RegionOne
    export PS1='[\u@\h \W(keystone_aliceanderson)]\$ '
    ```

0. Display the contents of keystonerc_aliceanderson and verify that they are correct
    
    `(keystone_admin)# cat keystonerc_aliceanderson`

0. Finally, lets repeat the process again for user bobbarker

    `(keystone_admin)# cp keystonerc_admin keystonerc_bobbarker`

    `(keystone_admin)# nano keystonerc_bobbarker`

0. Edit `keystonerc_bobbarker` so it looks like the following:

    ```
    export OS_USERNAME=bobbarker                       
    export OS_TENANT_NAME=acme_inc   
    export OS_PASSWORD=fa5tpa55w0rd          
    export OS_AUTH_URL=http://192.168.0.10:5000/v2.0/  
    export OS_REGION_NAME=RegionOne
    export PS1='[\u@\h \W(keystone_bobbarker)]\$ '     
    ```

0. Display the contents of keystonerc_bobbarker and verify that they are correct

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)] # cat keystonerc_bobbarker`

#### 5. Using the OpenStack Horizon Dashboard to create a `keystonerc_chestercopperpot` file for Chester Copperpot of Vault Tek

0. Log in to the OpenStack Horizon Dashboard as `chestercopperpot:fa5tpa55w0rd`

0. Click on **Project > Compute > Access & Security**

0. Click on the tab **API Access**

0. In the upper right corner, click on the button **Download OpenStack RC File**

    ![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/YUdErel.png)

0. This file will download locally. Open it with Notepad++ or your favorite text editor. If your "favorite" text editor is Microsoft Notepad or Microsoft Word, then it is recommended you take 2 minutes and go [download Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.8.2.html). The file you open will look similar to the one shown below.

    ``` bash
    #!/bin/bash
    # To use an OpenStack cloud you need to authenticate against the Identity
    # service named keystone, which returns a **Token** and **Service Catalog**.
    # The catalog contains the endpoints for all services the user/tenant has
    # access to - such as Compute, Image Service, Identity, Object Storage, Block
    # Storage, and Networking (code-named nova, glance, keystone, swift,
    # cinder, and neutron).
    #
    #
    # *NOTE*: Using the 2.0 *Identity API* does not necessarily mean any other
    # OpenStack API is version 2.0. For example, your cloud provider may implement
    # Image API v1.1, Block Storage API v2, and Compute API v2.0. OS_AUTH_URL is
    # only for the Identity API served through keystone.
    export OS_AUTH_URL=http://192.168.0.10:5000/v2.0
    #
    #
    # With the addition of Keystone we have standardized on the term **tenant**
    # as the entity that owns the resources.
    export OS_TENANT_ID=57dc930957f243438e532163269138d1
    export OS_TENANT_NAME="vault_tek"
    export OS_PROJECT_NAME="vault_tek"
    #
    #
    # In addition to the owning entity (tenant), OpenStack stores the entity
    # performing the action as the **user**.
    export OS_USERNAME="chestercopperpot"
    #
    #    #    #    # COPY THIS     #    #    #    #
    # With Keystone you pass the keystone password.
    echo "Please enter your OpenStack Password: "
    read -sr OS_PASSWORD_INPUT
    export OS_PASSWORD=$OS_PASSWORD_INPUT
    #    #    #    # END COPY THIS     #    #    #    #
    #
    # If your configuration has multiple regions, we set that information here.
    # OS_REGION_NAME is optional and only valid in certain environments.
    export OS_REGION_NAME="RegionOne"
    #
    #
    # Don't leave a blank variable, unset it if it was empty
    if [ -z "$OS_REGION_NAME" ]; then unset OS_REGION_NAME; fi
    ```
 
    >This file is a bit fancier than the previous one we studied, but it is well commented. There are two key differences between this file and ours:
    >
    > 1) The first is that this will file will require the user to enter their password instead of storing it locally as plain-text. In production, this is desirable, as asking users to enter their password will prevent admins from having to manage security and permissions on user files because they contain plain-text passwords.
    > 2) The second difference is that this file also sets some additional environmental variables, which could be problematic, as our other keystonerc_.* files do NOT set these variables. If we source back to another user without first unsetting these variables, we might get ourselves into trouble. So instead of using this file, let's just borrow the piece of code that asks the user for the password. It is shown below for reference:

    ```
    # With Keystone you pass the keystone password. 
    echo "Please enter your OpenStack Password: "
    read -sr OS_PASSWORD_INPUT
    export OS_PASSWORD=$OS_PASSWORD_INPUT`
    ```

0. Return to your SSH session with the controller (log in with root if you closed the previous session)

0. Let's create a new user (Doris Day) within the vault_tek vault_tek project (tenant) and then create a source file that prompts for a password.

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)] # keystone user-create --name dorisday --tenant vault_tek --pass pa55w0rd --email dorisday@vault_tek.example`

0. Create a file we can source for Doris Day of Vault Tek.

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)] # nano keystonerc_dorisday`

0. Edit `keystonerc_dorrisday` so it looks like the following:

    ```
    export OS_USERNAME=dorisday
    export OS_TENANT_NAME=vault_tek
    echo "Please enter your OpenStack Password: "   
    read -sr OS_PASSWORD_INPUT`
    export OS_PASSWORD=$OS_PASSWORD_INPUT
    export OS_AUTH_URL=http://192.168.0.10:5000/v2.0/
    export OS_REGION_NAME=RegionOne
    export PS1='[\u@\h \W(keystone_dorisday)]\$ '
    ```

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)] # source keystonerc_dorisday`

0. When prompted for a password, type: `fa5tpa55w0rd`

0. Make sure the file works. Test by issuing a CLI command requiring authentication.

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_dorisday)] # nova flavor-list`
    
    >If output is displayed, then it worked!

#### 6. Keystone Service Catalog (Services in the OpenStack cloud)

Users control the OpenStack cloud by issuing API calls. The OpenStack identity service (Keystone), in addition to distributing tokens, also distributes the service catalog. The service catalog discloses the services offered by the OpenStack cloud. The service catalog allows API clients to dynamically discover, and therefore navigate, where cloud services are located. Of course, the service catalog will likely be unique per deployment, but may also be unique per tenant (project).  

0. Source the admin's keysteonrc file
    
    `[root@controller] # source keystonerc_admin`

0. Display the service catalog for the OpenStack admin

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)] # keystone catalog`

0. Display the service catalog for the OpenStack admin

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)] # keystone catalog`
