## Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to show how to locate the various logs for services supporting OpenStack, thereby allowing admins to monitor their OpenStack deployment.

0. Where are the logs?
Most OpenStack services use the convention of writing their log files to sub directories of /var/log/

0. Display the nova-* service logs

	`[root@controller ] # ls /var/log/nova`

0. Display the glance-* service logs
	
	`[root@controller ] # ls /var/log/glance`

0. Display the cinder-* service logs

	`[root@controller ] # ls /var/log/cinder`

0. Display the keystone-* service logs

	`[root@controller ] # ls /var/log/keystone`

0. Display the horizon service logs
	
	`[root@controller ] # ls /var/log/horizon`

	`swift, dnsmasq (on all nodes)`

	`[root@controller ] # ls /var/log/syslog`
 
	`libvirt (on compute nodes)`

	`[root@compute1 ] # cat /var/log/libvirt/libvirtd.log`

0. Boot up messages for VM instances (on compute nodes)

	`[root@compute1 ] # cat /var/lib/nova/instances/instance-<instance id>/console.log`

0. Display cinder-volume logs (on block storage nodes)

	`[root@compute1 ] # cat /var/log/cinder/cinder-volume.log`
