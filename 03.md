#### 1. Creating a Project and User at the CLI

Back to our story. Remember, we still promised our customer Vault Tek Enterprise that they could have access to a project space with a single user, Chester Copperpot. Let's try setting this user up at the CLI.

1. SSH to the IP address of your controller (PuTTy is fine). If you are unsure how to do this, or what your controller's IP address is, ask the instructor.

2. Login as admin using the same password you use to access the OpenStack Horizon web console.

3. Apply the admin access variables to the bash environment. It prevents you from issuing needlessly long CLI commands. This will be covered in another lesson if it has not been covered already.

    `[root@controller] # source keystonerc_admin`

4.  Keystone's job is management of users and credentials. Issue this command to the keystone service to create a new tenant.

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)] # keystone tenant-create --name vault_tek`

    > Notice the deprecation warning message that came up? If you didn't, let's check it out now. 

    ```
    /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/keystoneclient/shell.py:65: DeprecationWarning: The keystone CLI is deprecated in favor of python-openstackclient. For a Pyth
    , continue using python-keystoneclient.
      'python-keystoneclient.', DeprecationWarning)
    ```

    > The openstack cli has been rewritten (python openstack wrapper).  These commands will still work, at least for now, but support has moved to the new cli client.

5. Create the user chestercopperpot, within the tenant (project) vault_tek, the password fa5tpa55w0rd, and the email address chester@vault_tek.example

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)] # keystone user-create --name chestercopperpot --tenant vault_tek --pass fa5tpa55w0rd --email chester@vault_tek.example`

    > If this command is successfully run, you should see output similar to below:

    ``` 
    +----------+----------------------------------+
    | Property |              Value               |
    +----------+----------------------------------+
    |  email   |    chester@vault_tek.example     |
    | enabled  |               True               |
    |    id    | c9b7d3be7fe843c78412ff510457ddd3 |
    |   name   |         chestercopperpot         |
    | tenantId | a411280ca390483ea2161209371d133a |
    | username |         chestercopperpot         |
    +----------+----------------------------------+
    ```

6. Display the tenants (projects) currently available. 

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)] # keystone tenant-list`

    > This command is analogous to looking at the Identity > Projects page in the Horizon dashboard.

7. Display the users that have been created in the system. 

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)] # keystone user-list`
    
    > This command is analogous to looking at the Identity > Users page in the Horizon dashboard

8. Log in to the Horizon interface as `chestercopperpot:fa5tpa55w0rd`

9. When you log in, you should be part of the new project called vault_tek. Click around, and make sure everything appears as you would expect it to within the OpenStack Horizon dashboard.

10. That's it! Good job. Leave everything the way it is. We'll tweak the acme_inc and vault_tek tenants (projects) in a subsequent lab.

#### 2. Creating a Project at the CLI (using python-openstackcleint) â€“ Reference & Rocket Scientists only

This section is only for reference. It shows the steps that you would need to take to use python-openstackclient to create the project 'vault_tek' and the user 'chestercopperpot'. You already did this so there is no need to do it a second time. However, if you are a rocket scientist and finished this lab early, feel free to stare & compare and play around with the python-openstackclient environment.

0. SSH into your controller as root, then type the following commands:

    `[root@controller] # source keystonerc_admin`

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)] # openstack`

    `(openstack) project create vault_tek`

    `(openstack) user create chestercopperpot --project vault_tek --password fa5tpa55w0rd --email chester@vault_tek.example`
